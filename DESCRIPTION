Description: We integrate glmnet within the CovCoExpNets R package to create covariate-specific GCNs based on relevant predictors 
    (i.e. predictors with non-zero coefficients) as detected by the LASSO regularization mechanism. Each hub gene leads to exactly 
    a new module in the covariate-specific GCN. To complete the composition of those gene modules, for each hub gene s, we create 
    a basic linear model age ~ s + b0 and keep adding genes to the model, choosing amongst the genes with highest correlation with 
    the hub s. We do this while the R2 of the model improves. Each new module´s gene set is annotated with gProfiler2 with the 
    sources GO, KEGG and REAC.
